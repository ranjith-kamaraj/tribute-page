      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>Abdul Kalam will remain one of the finest human beings to have ever lived. He lived an illustrious and successful life, and his legacy will continue to inspire people around the world in the coming years. Below is a list that tries to do justice to his numerous achievements:</p>
     <li>After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Mr Kalam joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He designed helicopters for the Indian Army, but he always said he didn’t feel at home at the DRDO.</li>
      <li> In 1969 he got the Government’s approval to expand the programme by including more engineers and scientists.</li>
       <li> After he was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Mr Kalam worked as the project director for SLV-III, India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle.</li>
      <li>In the 1980s he led India’s missile programme. Under his leadership, India became a major military power after the successes of Agni and Prithvi.</li>
      <li> In 1998, the Pokhran-II tests cemented India’s nuclear prowess. Mr Kalam played the pivotal role in the project. He firmly told the international community that such arms were only to deter other nations from trying to subjugate India, and were only to be used as “weapons of peace”.</li>
      <li> In a rare show of unity, all political parties unanimously voted for Mr Kalam in 2002 as the 11th President of India.</li>
